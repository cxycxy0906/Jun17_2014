This is **an R Markdown** document. Markdown is _a simple_ formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
5+3
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
plot(cars)
```

The mean of some number is: `r mean(c(1,2,3))`.
